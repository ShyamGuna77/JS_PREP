- This challenge will test your skills of writing efficient code using functions in JavaScript.


# Coin Change Problem

## Problem Statement

Given an array of coin denominations, write a function to compute the number of ways you can make a given amount using those coins. You have an unlimited supply of each coin type.

## Input
- **amount**: The target amount you need to make (in cents).
- **coins**: An array of coin denominations (in cents). You have an unlimited number of each coin type available.

## Output
- The number of distinct ways to make the given amount using the available coins.

## Example

### Sample Input:

```plaintext
amount = 4
coins = [1, 2, 3]
```

## Sample Output:
```
4
```
## Explanation:
- There are 4 different ways to make the amount 4 using the coins [1, 2, 3]:

 - 1, 1, 1, 1
 - 1, 1, 2
-  1, 3
 - 2, 2

Each of the above coin combinations sums to 4.
